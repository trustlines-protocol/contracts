`next`_ (unreleased)
-----------------------
`3.0.0`_ (2022-12-16)
-----------------------
* Added: new contracts `CurrencyNetworkV3`, and `CurrencyNetworkOwnableV3`. 
  They have a new `transfer(address, value)` function abused by Gnosis safes to track delegate debt.
  This functionally replaces the `increaseDebt(address, value)` function.
* Updated: migration script to move users from one currency network to another now translates addresses of users
  from the TL-identity contract to the corresponding Gnosis-safe contract addresses with the same user. Migration script
  no longer freezes currency networks, as they will not be able to be frozen on tlbc.
* Added: gnosis safe implementation and proxy factory added to `test` cli used in the TL e2e tests.
 
`2.0.0`_ (2021-04-27)
-----------------------
* Added: new contracts `CurrencyNetworkV2`, `CurrencyNetworkOwnableV2` and `CurrencyNetworkBasicV2`.
  They have an option to add a payment request when opening a trustline via additional parameter `int72 _transfer` of
  function `updateTrustline`.
  The event `TrustlineUpdateRequest` now also has the additional corresponding argument `int72 _transfer`
* Added: function in tlbin to load merged abi `load_packaged_merged_abis`. This return a dict object similar to
  a regular `contracts.json` file with a key `MergedCurrencyNetworksAbi` that contains the merged abi of networks
  version 1, version 2, and of proxies.

`1.3.0`_ (2021-02-12)
-----------------------
* Updated: properly get the `isFrozen` status for trustlines during migration, no longer resulting
  in constantly frozen trustlines.
* Updated: now migrate pending trustline requests when migrating networks.
* Updated: `tl-deploy deploy-and-migrate` will now output JSON a file with a mapping from old to new network
  see `--output` option
* Updated: force the user to provide --gas-price when deploying contracts.
  Prevents the node from failing to provide a gas-price. (results from contract-deploy-tools dependency upgrade)
* Updated: remove the --auto-nonce option, now used per default.
  The tool will query the node for the nonce unless explicitly provided with`--nonce`. (results from contract-deploy-tools dependency upgrade)

* Added: Event `NetworkUnfreeze` emitted when unfreezing a network after migration
* Added: Event `OwnerRemoval` emitted when removing the owner of a network after migration

`1.2.0`_ (2020-01-25)
-----------------------
* Updated: limit interest rates in currency networks to `+-20%`
* Updated: limit balance with negative interests to old balance to avoid increasing the balance
  instead of lowering it when calculation fails
* Updated: all contracts updated to solc 0.8.0
* Updated: functions to deploy network now use `tl-deploy.core.NetworkSettings` object to be more explicit as to
  what settings it expects.

* Added: function in currency network `closeTrustlineByDirectTransfer` to close a trustline
  by making a direct transfer of the balance if the balance is in between min and max arguments
* Added: owned currency network able to set trustlines before giving up ownership. Usable to migrate old networks
* Added: command in tl-deploy for migrating old contracts to new ones:
  `tl-deploy migration` and `tl-deploy verify-migration`
* Added: Upgradeable currency networks via beacon and proxy pattern
* Added: `tl-deploy beacon` command to deploy a beacon. Beacons are used as the source of information for the
  implementation address to be used by currency network proxies
* Added: `deploy-and-migrate` command to deploy new currency network proxies and migrate old networks to new ones

`1.1.7`_ (2020-10-12)
-----------------------
* Fixed: packing of contracts in trustlines-contracts-bin,
  it was not working properly when installed in editable mode.
* Added: Natspec missing to some contracts functions
* Updated: dependencies updated, notably contract-deploy-tools==0.8.0 and web3==5.12.1

`1.1.6`_ (2020-08-24)
-----------------------
* Added: function for delegate to find the implementation address of an identity proxy:
  `Delegate.get_implementation_address(identity_address)`
* Added: Deploy a second identity implementation contract in the the `tldeploy test` command.
  this can be used for testing the update of identity implementations.

`1.1.5`_ (2020-07-21)
-----------------------
* Add means to get contracts.json from py-bin: `from tlbin import load_packaged_contracts`

`1.1.4`_ (2020-04-15)
-----------------------
* Fix bug in interests calculations that would cause the balance to flip sign for big values of negative interests.
  Set the balance to 0 when this should happen instead.

`1.1.3`_ (2020-02-28)
-----------------------

* Change signature of functions `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `debitTransfer`, `transferReceiverPays`
  so that it no longer takes `_to` argument but takes a complete path including sender and receiver (BREAKING)
* Change: Lower the absolute max value of balances from `2**71 - 1` to `2**64 - 1` to match maximum transferable value

  is that users do not have to pay for gas directly.

`0.5.1`_ (2019-01-23)
-----------------------
* Fix internal version dependency, 0.5.0 was broken

`0.5.0`_ (2019-01-23)
-----------------------
* Remove old populus dependency and substitute it with contract-deploy-tools

`0.4.0`_ (2018-12-10)
-----------------------
* Remove the fees on the last hop

  A user now only has to pay fees to the true mediators and not anymore to the receiver.

* Add transfer function where receiver pays the fees

  It is now possible to make payments, where the receiver will pay the fees.

* Round up fees

  We are now properly rounding up the fees, where before we used an own formular that was
  already close to rounding up.

* Bug Fix #159
  that an old trustline request could be accepted

`0.3.3`_ (2018-11-28)
-----------------------
* Bug fix deploy tool so that it is possible to deploy a network with zero fees
* First version of trustlines-contracts-abi on npm.

`0.3.2`_ (2018-11-26)

* Optimize gas cost of contracts

`0.3.1`_ (2018-11-13)
-----------------------
* Fix a dependency issue

`0.3.0`_ (2018-11-12)
-----------------------
* Added interests to currency networks

  A trustline now also consists of two interest rates given by the two parties to each other.
  These interest rates are used to calculate occured interests between the two parties. The balance
  including the interests is updated whenever the balance (because of a transfer) or one of
  the interest rates (because of a trustline update) changes. To calculate the interests we
  approximate Continuous Compounding with a taylor series and use the current timestamp and
  the timestamp of the last update.

* Added interest settings to deploy tool

  The deploy tool now allows deploying networks with different interests settings. The current options
  are: Default interests: If this is set, every trustline has the same interest rate.
  Custom interest: If this is set, every user can decide which interest rate he want to give.
  Prevent mediator interests: Safe setting to prevent mediators from paying interests for
  mediated transfer by disallowing certain transfers.

* Close a trustline

  Added a new function to do a triangular payment to close a trustline. This will set the balance
  between two user to zero and also removes all information about this trustline. This is still work
  in progress and might change.

`0.2.0`_ (2018-09-19)
-----------------------
* the python package `trustlines-contracts` is now superseded by the
  trustlines-contracts-deploy package. The old namespace tlcontracts is gone.
  The python code now lives in the tldeploy package. The tl-deploy script should
  work as before, but the installation got a lot easier (i.e. just pip install
  trustlines-contracts-deploy)

The rest of the changes are only interesting for developers:

* the internal tests do not rely on populus being installed. populus isn't a
  dependency of trustlines-contracts-deploy anymore.
* populus is still needed for smart contract compilation. It's being installed
  to a local virtualenv automatically by the newly introduced Makefile.
* The field capacityImbalanceFeeDivisor was made public. As a result, there's
  now a getter function for it in the ABI.

`0.1.3`_ (2018-09-04)

* trustlines-contracts-deploy has been released to PyPI

`0.1.2`_ (2018-08-21)
